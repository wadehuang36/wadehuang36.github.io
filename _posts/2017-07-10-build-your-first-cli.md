If you are a developer, you should be some how or familiar with [command-line user interface(cli)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) because a lot of tools provide CLI such git, npm-cli, python-cli, dotnet-cli, aws-cli and more. CLI tools have many advantages than GUI tools like launch easily, development easily and cross-platform easily. Cli tool is good for you at some scenarios, for example, csv files import, batch jobs or schedule jobs. Therefore, this blog-post will show you a easy way to build a cross-platform CLI tool.

I use Nodejs to build the CLI tool. There are 3 benefits:
- Nodejs is cross-platform, CLI tools can be run on Windows, Mac and Linux.
- Easy to distribution. You can publish the cli tool to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or just make a package to install privately.
- Easy to build. Only few lines, the project can be turned to a CLI tool.

## Requirement
- Nodejs(https://nodejs.org/)

Try this command to see your computer has nodejs installed.
``` bash
node --version
```
You can go to [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install it if you haven't installed on your computer.

# Hello World
Let's start an easiest example.

## Initialization
``` bash
mkdir build-cli-example
cd build-cli-example
npm init --yes
```
Those commands will create a package.json.

## Add bin in ./package.json
``` json
{
  "name": "build-cli-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bin":{
    "my-cli" : "./my-cli"
  }
}
```

`bin` is the command name and we named it `my-cli`. Its value is a file like below.

## Add ./my-cli file
``` js
#!/usr/bin/env node
require("./index.js")
```
The first line tells NPM what kind of environment the file is. It is very important because without this line. NPM cannot generate bin files correctly.
The other lines are regular Nodejs code. There just calls `./index.js`.

## Add ./index.js file
```js
console.log("hello would")
```
For our first step, we just print the greeting word.

## Pack, Install and Test
```
npm pack
npm install -g build-cli-example-1.0.0.tgz
my-cli
```

### The Execution Result

> when you run `npm install -g build-cli-example-1.0.0.tgz` to install the package, npm will generate `my-cli` (sh file) and `my-cli.cmd` in the npm file.
Because the npm file is in `PATH`, so when we type `my-cli`. The OS can find `my-cli` to execute.

# Parameter Parser
The really CLI tool usually can allow users input some parameters to change its behaviors. You can use `process.argv` to get input parameters and parse them, but don't build your own wheels if there are many parsers you can use. I recommend [command-line-args](https://www.npmjs.com/package/command-line-args), it is a very good parameter parser.

## Install command-line-args
```
npm install --save command-line-args 
```

## New ./index.js
``` js
const commandLineArgs = require('command-line-args')

const optionDefinitions = [
    { name: 'env', alias: "e", type: String, defaultValue: "local" },    
    { name: 'files', alias: "t", type: String, multiple: true },    
    { name: 'help', alias: "h", type: Boolean },
    { name: 'new', alias: "n", type: Boolean },
    { name: 'size', alias: "s", type: Number, defaultValue: 100 }
]

const options = commandLineArgs(optionDefinitions, { partial: true });

if (options.help || options._unknown) {
    if (options._unknown) {
        console.log("Unknown options:", options._unknown);
    }

    // TODO:Print Help
} else {
    // Do some jobs
}
```
The command-line-args is straight forward to use, you can see [command-line-args](https://www.npmjs.com/package/command-line-args) for complete information. 

### Test
``` bash
my-cli -e qa --files ./a.txt ./b.txt
```

# Print Help
One thing I complain command-line-args is that its usage generation is separated to another package `command-line-usage`. So you have to define parser and usage on the different place.

## Install command-line-usage
```
npm install -S command-line-usage
```

## Replace TODO
``` js
const usage = require('command-line-usage');

const sections = [
    {
        header: 'My CLI',
        content: 'description'
    },
    {
        header: 'Options',
        optionList: [
            {
                name: 'new',
                alias: "n"
            },
            {
                name: 'size',
                alias: "s",
                description: 'Batch Size, default is 100'
            },
            {
                name: 'files',
                alias: "f",
                multiple: true,
                typeLabel: '[underline]{file} ...'
            },
            {
                name: 'env',
                alias: "e",
                description: 'Environment, default is local'
            },
            {
                name: 'help',
                alias: "h",
                description: 'Print the usage guide'
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        header: 'Examples',
        content: [
            {
                desc: "env",
                example: "my-cli --env dev"
            },
            {
                desc: "files",
                example: "my-cli --files a.txt b.txt"
            }
        ]
    },
]

console.log(usage(sections))
```
you can see [command-line-args](https://www.npmjs.com/package/command-line-usage) for complete information. 

### Test
Run `npm pack` and `npm install -g` as below to reinstall the package.

``` bash
my-cli --help
```

# Summary
This is the [Source Code](https://github.com/wadehuang36/build-cli-example) of this example. You can see only few lines for building a CLI tool.
